# Processor

The processor is simply the part of afrim who manage the I/O operations via the keyboard, allowing you insert and remove character in the sequence. Possible use cases are:
- Insert a character in the sequence.
- Clear the sequence.
- Commit the corresponding output of a sequence.
- Rollback a previous commit.

For the moment, no customization can be done at this level.
