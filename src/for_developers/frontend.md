Frontend
===

A "frontend" is simply a API which `clafrica` will invoke to render some useful information to the user. Once the frontend receives this information, it is free to do whatever it wants.

We will not tell more about how to implement a frontend but you can consult the source of code of one of our [official frontend](https://github.com/pythonbrad/clafrica-wish) if you want.
